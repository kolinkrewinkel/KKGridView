High-performance iOS grid view (MIT license). **Requirements**: you
need to build `KKGridView` with a compiler that supports *Automatic
Reference Counting*. We know this stings at first, but we strongly
believe that the future is better served by requiring this
now. Moreover, the move to ARC improved `KKGridView`'s performance
greatly. Remember that your project need not use ARC to include
`KKGridView`.

### Contributing
If you see something you don't like, you are always
welcome to submit it as an issue. But if you can find it in your
heart, we'd be so grateful if you would fix it yourself and send us a
pull request. We promise not to bite!


##Current Issues

Most features, bugs, and missing items for the project are in the
Issues section.  Currently, there are placement issues after
inserting.  We were initially going to fix these before public
release, but instead decided to release now and allow outside
contribution.  Other than that, editing and selection are the only
things that need work.

##Motivations

`KKGridView` was created in July 2011 for usage in a few of the apps I
was working on.  When I discovered that this would be both very
difficult and time consuming, I sought out the help of [Giulio
Petek](http://twitter.com/GiloTM) and [Jonathan
Sterling](http://twitter.com/jonsterling).  Additionally, we brought
on [Kyle Hickinson](http://twitter.com/kylehickinson), [Matthias
Tretter](http://twitter.com/myell0w), and most recently, [Peter
Steinberger](http://twitter.com/steipete). We had all been frustrated
by the existing grid view components; with this in mind, we set out to
create the best grid view component available for iOS to-date.

##Goals

When we set out building this, we all had a few common things we knew we needed to focus on.

* Performance — 55+ FPS in the worst case.
* `UITableView` similarities — Strive to be as close to drop-in as possible.
* Feature completeness — As above, match the latest UITableView implementation in features; add anything else worthwhile.
* Solid codebase — We didn't want something that was inextensible and 
full of messy code.

##Project Integration

* Create a new workspace in Xcode in the same directory as your existing *.xcodeproj.
* Drag in your existing Xcode project.
* Locate your copy of KKGridView, drag KKGridView.xcodeproj into the workspace so that it stays at the top of the hierarchy, just like your original project.
* In the Build Phases section of your original project, link your project with libKKGridView.a.
* Now, simply import KKGridView just like an Apple framework:

~~~~objc
#import <KKGridView/KKGridView.h>
~~~~
* You can do this wherever necessary, though we think it's best to simply import in your prefix (.pch) file.

##Usage

KKGridViewController, like UITableViewController, can automatically instantiate a grid view for you.  Simply subclass it and customize away.  

**As an alternative, one can perform custom instantiation, as shown below.**

First, instantiate a grid view instance.  *Using the designated initializer and a `_gridView` ivar:*

~~~~objc
_gridView = [[KKGridView alloc] initWithFrame:self.view.bounds dataSource:self delegate:self];
~~~~

Now, you can setup your default `UIScrollView` and `UIView` properties, since `KKGridView` inherits from said class.

~~~~objc
_gridView.scrollsToTop = YES;
_gridView.backgroundColor = [UIColor darkGrayColor];
_gridView.autoresizingMask = UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleHeight;
~~~~

Metrics must also be set (automatic sizing *may* come in the future).

~~~~objc
_gridView.cellSize = CGSizeMake(75.f, 75.f);
_gridView.cellPadding = CGSizeMake(4.f, 4.f);
~~~~

Now, other properties available in the header file can be set.

~~~~objc
_gridView.allowsMultipleSelection = NO;

UIView *headerView = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, self.view.bounds.size.width, 50.f)];
headerView.backgroundColor = [UIColor redColor];
_gridView.gridHeaderView = headerView;
[headerView release] /* For the non-ARC users amongst us */
~~~~

Finally, you can set the grid as your view.

~~~~objc
self.view = _gridView;
~~~~

Alternatively, you can add the grid to your view-hierarchy.

~~~~objc
[self.view addSubview:_gridView];
~~~~

###Data source methods:

~~~~objc
- (NSUInteger)gridView:(KKGridView *)gridView numberOfItemsInSection:(NSUInteger)section
{
  return kCellCounts[section];
}
~~~~

Optionally, you can specify how many section you would like in the grid. *(Default is 1)*

~~~~objc
- (NSUInteger)numberOfSectionsInGridView:(KKGridView *)gridView
{
  return kNumSections;
}
~~~~

The last required method is to return a cell, just like UITableView.
We've made it easier on you, though. `KKIndexPath` works in just the
same way as `NSIndexPath`, only `-row` is replaced with
`-index`. `KKGridViewCell`, like `UITableViewCell`, is designed to be
subclassed.*

~~~~objc
- (KKGridViewCell *)gridView:(KKGridView *)gridView cellForItemAtIndexPath:(KKIndexPath *)indexPath
{
  KKGridViewCell *cell = [KKGridViewCell cellForGridView:gridView];
  cell.backgroundColor = [UIColor lightGrayColor];
  return cell;
}
~~~~

There are no required delegate methods, though all that are implemented in `UITableView` will soon be available in `KKGridView`.
